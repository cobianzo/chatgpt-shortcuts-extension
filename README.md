# Cobi Prompt Extension

This extension adds a button to the ChatGPT prompt page that allows you to save text snippets as shortcuts. You can then use these shortcuts in your prompts by typing `/shortcut_name`. The extension also allows you to edit and remove shortcuts.

For example, you might save a prompt as `/sa` and make it equivalent as typing `give me a short answer, no more than one paragraph`. and then type `/sa` in the prompt field to get the same prompt.

You can also add new shortcuts by typing `/` in the prompt field and then selecting the "Edit Shortcuts" button. From there, you can add, edit, or remove shortcuts and save them to your browser's local storage.
